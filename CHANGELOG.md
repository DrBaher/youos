# Changelog

## v0.1.1 — 2026-03-16

### New features
- WhatsApp export ingestion — `youos ingest --whatsapp <path>` to add WhatsApp chats to your corpus
- `youos doctor` — pre-flight health checker with green/red output (Python, gog, mlx_lm, config, disk, port)
- `youos improve --verbose` — step-by-step Rich progress output for the nightly pipeline
- Thread support in Draft UI — paste a full email thread; YouOS extracts the latest message and uses history as context
- Rate limiting — 10 drafts/min per IP on `/feedback/generate` and `/draft/stream`
- Structured autoresearch run log — `var/autoresearch_runs.jsonl` for reliable benchmark trend tracking
- Pipeline failure log — `var/pipeline_last_run.json` with status, timestamp, and errors visible in Stats dashboard
- `youos export` — backup corpus, adapter, and feedback pairs to a tar.gz archive
- `youos quickstart` — lightweight onramp (3 steps) for users who already have gog configured

### Improvements
- Retrieval candidate pool now ordered by recency (`paired_at DESC`) instead of random
- Mobile-responsive UI — feedback and stats pages stack cleanly at ≤768px
- `retrieval.yaml` defaults tuned: `top_k_reply_pairs=8`, `recency_boost_days=60`
- `youos setup` now runs `youos doctor` as step 0 and bails early on failures
- Autoresearch log moved from project root to `var/autoresearch_log.md`
- `youos stats` CLI unified with web stats via shared query layer
- Session tokens persisted to `var/sessions.json` — survive server restarts

### Fixes
- PRIVACY.md contact URL corrected to `DrBaher/youos`
- `.clawhubignore` added to exclude tests, fixtures, `.venv`, and build artifacts from publish
- `gif-frames/` excluded from git and clawhub publish
